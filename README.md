# Discovering Ireland

This app was designed to give tourist information about Ireland with all of the 32 counties within Ireland. The information each user will get forms into two parts, 1 a short description of each county, 2 a full insight of the county they selected which a website will appear on all information to do with activities, accommodation and etc.
We all love to take a photo even when there on holidays, this app will also provide a camera feature with just one click to get started. The photos the user take will save on iPhone or iPad and the will have access to them from their photo library.
The final part of this app will prevent the user from getting lost by sharing their current location while they navigate through Ireland.
